## Description
This project contains code for a general purpose Partially Observable Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm taken from [1]. This is an online POMDP solver, *ie* it approximates the optimal policy locally at the current belief. 

## Documentation

The documentation of each function can be found in the code (just below the function's declaration), and the documentation format is compatible with doxygen.
